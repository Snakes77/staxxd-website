========================================
STEP 1: LOG INTO HOSTINGER
========================================
1. Go to hpanel.hostinger.com

========================================
STEP 2: CREATE FOLDERS FIRST
========================================
In public_html, create these 3 folders:

1. Click "New Folder" button
   → Name it: images
   → Click "Create"

2. Click "New Folder" button
   → Name it: videos
   → Click "Create"

3. Click "New Folder" button
   → Name it: services
   → Click "Create"

========================================
STEP 3: UPLOAD ROOT FILES (9 files)

========================================
STEP 7: VERIFY STRUCTURE
========================================
After uploading, your public_html should look like this:

public_html/
├── index.html                    ← Root file
├── about.html                     ← Root file
├── contact.html                   ← Root file
├── services.html                  ← Root file
├── privacy.html                   ← Root file
├── cookies.html                   ← Root file
├── style.css                      ← Root file
├── script.js                      ← Root file
├── icon.svg                       ← Root file
├── images/                        ← FOLDER
│   ├── staxxd-chameleon.web.png
│   ├── Staxxd.png
│   └── CHM.Staxxd (1).png
├── videos/                        ← FOLDER
│   ├── staxxd-hero-dino.mov
│   └── staxxd-footer.mov
└── services/                      ← FOLDER
    ├── web-development.html
    ├── web-applications.html
    ├── google-apps-scripts.html
    ├── business-solutions.html
    ├── ai-powered-solutions.html
    └── process-automation.html

========================================
STEP 8: TEST YOUR SITE
========================================
After uploading, test these URLs:

✓ https://staxxd.co.uk/
✓ https://staxxd.co.uk/services/web-development.html
✓ https://staxxd.co.uk/about.html
✓ https://staxxd.co.uk/contact.html

If you get 404 errors, the files are in the wrong location!
