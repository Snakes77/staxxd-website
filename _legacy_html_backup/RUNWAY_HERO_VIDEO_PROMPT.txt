Modern UI elements floating or transitioning. Use cinematic lens quality, sharp focus, professional depth of field. Avoid cliché stock footage - create original, creative visuals.

SCENE BREAKDOWN:
0-3 seconds: "Staxxd" logo appears with the TWO X's in bright pink (#ff2e63). The letters S-t-a-d-d in white or dark. Dark background (#101216) with subtle tech elements. Smooth logo animation with professional fade-in. NO other text appears.

3-12 seconds: Showcase solutions with seamless transitions. Quick cuts or smooth pans between: modern website interfaces, web app dashboards, Google Workspace automation visuals, AI neural network patterns, business process flow diagrams, automation workflow graphics. All visuals use brand color palette - dark backgrounds with pink (#ff2e63) accents. Abstract tech elements (circuits, data flows) in background. Professional, fluid transitions between concepts. Maintain HD quality throughout. The "Staxxd" logo can remain visible or fade slightly but should return prominently.

12-20 seconds: Return to "Staxxd" logo prominence with pink X's clearly visible. Seamless transition back to opening frame for perfect loop. Ensure the pink X's are prominent and clearly visible. NO other text appears at any point.

ANIMATION REQUIREMENTS:
All motion must be smooth and professional. Use ease-in/ease-out timing. Subtle parallax effects acceptable. Particle effects or data visualizations should be subtle, not overwhelming. Logo animation should be elegant and confident. Transitions between service concepts should be fluid, not jarring. Maintain professional pacing throughout. Use cinematic camera movements where appropriate.

COLOR USAGE:
Primary backgrounds: #101216 (very dark) or #252a34 (dark blue-gray). Accent elements: #ff2e63 (vibrant pink) for highlights, CTAs, and CRITICALLY the two X's in the "Staxxd" logo. Light elements: #eaeaea for contrast. Secondary elements: #3a4252 for depth. Use gradients blending between brand colors smoothly. Pink (#ff2e63) should be prominent, especially for the X's in the logo.
