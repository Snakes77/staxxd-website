🚨 CRITICAL: Service Pages Upload Instructions

The service pages are getting 404 errors because they're not uploaded to Hostinger correctly.

✅ FIXED ISSUES:
1. ✅ Removed footer video from homepage services section
2. ✅ Favicon is correctly set in all pages (icon.svg)
3. ✅ All service pages have proper HTML structure

📁 UPLOAD THESE FILES TO HOSTINGER:

1. Go to Hostinger File Manager
2. Navigate to: public_html/
3. Create a folder named: services (if it doesn't exist)
4. Upload ALL 6 service HTML files into public_html/services/:

   ✓ web-development.html
   ✓ web-applications.html
   ✓ google-apps-scripts.html
   ✓ business-solutions.html
   ✓ ai-powered-solutions.html
   ✓ process-automation.html

5. Make sure icon.svg is in: public_html/icon.svg (root folder)

🔍 VERIFY AFTER UPLOAD:

Test these URLs (they should all work):
- https://staxxd.co.uk/services/web-development.html
- https://staxxd.co.uk/services/web-applications.html
- https://staxxd.co.uk/services/google-apps-scripts.html
- https://staxxd.co.uk/services/business-solutions.html
- https://staxxd.co.uk/services/ai-powered-solutions.html
- https://staxxd.co.uk/services/process-automation.html

❌ COMMON MISTAKES:
- Uploading to public_html/hostinger-upload/services/ (WRONG!)
- Uploading to public_html/services/services/ (WRONG!)
- Not creating the services folder first
- Uploading files to root instead of services folder

✅ CORRECT STRUCTURE:
public_html/
├── index.html
├── icon.svg ← Must be here for favicon
├── services/ ← Create this folder
│   ├── web-development.html
│   ├── web-applications.html
│   ├── google-apps-scripts.html
│   ├── business-solutions.html
│   ├── ai-powered-solutions.html
│   └── process-automation.html
