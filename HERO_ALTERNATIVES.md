# Hero Section Alternatives for Staxxd

Since Runway video generation isn't delivering the quality needed, here are better alternatives:

## Option 1: CSS Animated Hero (RECOMMENDED)
**Pros:**
- Full control over design
- Perfect brand colors
- Fast loading
- No video file needed
- Professional animated background
- Works perfectly with your pink X's logo

**Implementation:**
- Animated gradient background using brand colors
- Particle effects or geometric shapes
- Smooth CSS animations
- Your "Staxxd" logo with pink X's prominently displayed

## Option 2: Static Image with CSS Effects
**Pros:**
- Simple and reliable
- Fast loading
- Can use your existing images (Paul-1.png, etc.)
- Add CSS animations/overlays for movement
- Full control

## Option 3: Try Different AI Video Tools
**Alternatives to Runway:**
- **Pika Labs** - Often better text rendering
- **Stable Video Diffusion** - Good for abstract/tech visuals
- **Kling AI** - High quality output

## Option 4: Professional Video Service
**If budget allows:**
- Hire a motion graphics designer on Fiverr/Upwork
- Get exactly what you need

## Option 5: Hybrid Approach
**Best of both:**
